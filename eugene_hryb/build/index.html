                        <p class="project__article-text">Increasing prosperity in our lives can be accomplished by having
                            the right frame of mind. The truth is, our thoughts are very powerful.
                            They are capable of influencing every aspect of our daily lives, from our physical health to our
                            social behaviors. I’m sure you’ve heard the adage, “As you think, so shall you be.”
                            If we want to improve our lives, we must first improve our thoughts. Harnessing the power of
                            thought in a positive way has the ability to create great change in our lives, including our
                            financial well-being and prosperity. But how? How do we take something as intangible as
                            thoughts, and manifest them into a physical reality?
                            We must first understand that being prosperous is more than having a lot of money. Prosperity is
                            a mindset, a way of interacting in our lives, and a way of thinking. Mastering this train of
                            thought is not easy, but it is simple enough if we keep working on it consistently.
                            Following are some ideas to help you improve your thoughts, and ultimately attract more
                            prosperity into your life:
                            Be grateful for the blessings in your life right now. Take a few minutes each day to express
                            heartfelt gratitude for the good things in your life. Even more powerful, write a few of these
                            blessings down each day. This helps to put your focus in the right direction — on abundance, not
                            lack.
                            Use positive affirmations to begin training yourself to think positively. Use “I am” statements
                            such as “I am worthy of all that is good.” Write the statements down and repeat them nightly
                            before bed. Over time, this will implant these thoughts into your subconscious mind, and you
                            will begin to naturally believe them.
                            Creative visualization can help you achieve prosperity by determining what it is you wish to
                            achieve, and then thoroughly creating that image in your mind. This works in the same way
                            affirmations do. Our subconscious will fill with images of prosperity, and eventually these
                            subconscious “truths” will manifest in the physical. “See” yourself as being prosperous, and you
                            will become so.
                            Encourage yourself with the belief that you can achieve great things. This could also be one of
                            your affirmations, but expand on it. If you know you can earn a certain salary, tell yourself
                            you can earn more. Allow yourself to believe all things are possible, and you will gain the
                            confidence needed to reach higher than you ever imagined you could. If you believe you can do
                            it, you are more likely to take the risks associated with people who are highly successful.
                            Prosperity and success go hand in hand, so take risks and aim higher.
                            Start a savings account. As strange as it sounds, think about this: Like Attracts Like. Even if
                            you can only afford to put a few dollars into your account every month, it will begin to build
                            up and attract more money.
                            Finally, believe you are already wealthy. The creative ability of our thoughts is such that we
                            lend more power and energy to whatever we consistently focus on. Focusing on lack will create
                            more lack. Focusing on wealth and prosperity will create . . . guess what?
                            Remember that this is a process. You likely won’t change your circumstances in one day. But over
                            time, with consistent focus, your thoughts will begin to attract what you want. Once you master
                            this power of thought, there are truly no limits to what you can create!

                        <p class="project__article-text">Successful businesses have many things in common, today we’ll look
                            at the big ‘R’ of recognition and how a digital advertising network may help.
                            Recognition can be illustrated by two individuals entering a crowded room at a party. Both walk
                            to the far side of the room, one of them slips through the crowd easily and unnoticed as they
                            reach the far side. The second person takes much longer to reach the far side because they are
                            engaged in conversations along the way as they continue to meet acquaintances and friends during
                            their path. Which type of person would you like to model your business after?
                            Your business is in a continual battle for your customers’ recognition whether you know it or
                            not. If you happen to be fortunate enough to be in a marketplace with very few competitors, that
                            will not last for long. You need your business to be at the forefront of your client’s minds so
                            that when they require your products or services, you are the go-to people.
                            Marketing your business is a necessity. Putting your name and logo out there and keeping it
                            there is a must. This lets clients know that you are “still around” and in business. Frequency
                            is a good way to achieve the “stand out factor” in recognition. I am reminded of both television
                            and radio ads I had heard of in the past. They run continually with a catch phrase or musical
                            jingle over and over again on the radio or television until you are absolutely sick of hearing
                            it. You also cannot get it out of your head. Although this type of advertising is expensive, it
                            can be very effective, and the recognition factor is quite high. Television and radio can reach
                            a large audience, and they are broad in their appeal. In a brief sentence, you are paying to
                            market to both those that are your potential customers and a large segment of those who are not
                            now and probably never will be your customers.
                            There are more economical ways to pursue frequency, the point is to define your target market
                            demographic, and invest your marketing funds into the locations that will best be seen by them.
                            Another factor to consider is “can I market myself in a place where I will stand out from my
                            competition, or where my competition does not have a presence?” Why would you market yourself in
                            a flyer or newspaper right beside your competition and risk blending into a crowd, and
                            ultimately being ignored? Another issue to look at is diversification. As the saying goes,
                            “don’t put all your eggs in one basket”. When you look at your advertising budget for the year,
                            try to find the affordable solutions that will continue to reap during the full year of your
                            advertising budget. An expensive radio or television promotion may give short term gains for
                            that weekend sale, but what about the rest of the year? Your clients may end up with the
                            impression of where did they go, I haven’t seen or heard anything about them for so long.
                            Don’t always look for the old standbys in marketing, but keep your eyes and ears open for the
                            latest and greatest ways to market your business. With the costs of technology coming down
                            dramatically new options such as digital advertising on LCD and Plasma screens are becoming more
                            and more affordable, and the paper billboards and posters becoming a thing of the past. With the
                            flexibility, and curb appeal of full color and motion video footage with computer generated
                            graphics available to you, this is an option you don’t want to pass by without a good look.
                            Ultimately, recognition is required if you want to get people “in the door” of your business (or
                            on your website for the new e-businesses). This is going to cost you money, time and effort up
                            front any way that you look at it, but if you have successfully reached your target market, the
                            payoffs will be worth it.
